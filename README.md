# Welcome to TenFingers!

When you start the application, the 60-second timer will begin as soon as you see the words to test yourself.

The program consists of two main stages:
- **Create an account** to track your scores
- **Guest User mode** to view only your current score

## Creating an Account
To add an account, simply press the **Q** key and fill in the required information. Creating an account is useful for breaking your old scores and tracking your progress.

## Guest User Entry
If you prefer not to create an account, you can start the application directly by pressing the **y** key and view your current score. However, if you wish to return, you will need to restart the application.

## For Developers
The database can be found in the `tenfingersSQL` folder. Make sure to configure it according to your needs while using the project.
